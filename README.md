## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.


## Algorithm:

1. Define Experiment Scope : Clearly outline the purpose and boundaries of the experiment by selecting relevant domains or topics

2. Prepare Prompts and Outputs : Develop paired prompts for every selected topic—first a broad or unstructured prompt that elicits a general response, and then a refined prompt that requests specific information, explanation, or analysis.

3. Query AI Model : Submit each prepared prompt to the chosen AI model (such as GPT, Claude, Gemini) separately—first the basic prompts, then the refined ones—to gather a complete set of responses for all scenarios.

4. Evaluate Responses : Analyze the model’s answers using predefined criteria including quality (clarity and relevance), accuracy (correctness of content), and depth (level of detail, insight, and explanation).

5. Compare Results : Systematically compare the answers given by the AI to the basic versus the refined prompts for each topic.

6. Conclude Insights : Draw overall conclusions based on the experiment’s findings, describing the specific benefit of refined prompt engineering on AI output performance.
